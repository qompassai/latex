\lettersection{Introduction}
It is a pleasure to apply for the Health Plan Navigator Specialist / Care Coordinator II position with Project Access Northwest. My career has centered on expanding healthcare access through service coordination, outreach, and data-driven innovation. I believe this role directly aligns with both my professional experience and lifelong commitment to improving equitable healthcare across Washington.

\lettersection{Professional Background}
My multidisciplinary background integrates medical, technological, and organizational leadership. As the Founder of Qompass AI, I lead initiatives that combine health education and analytics to help underserved communities navigate complex systems efficiently and respectfully. At Washington State University’s Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine, I co-founded a mentorship and outreach network that supported over 8,000 youth and community members and built an AI-enabled knowledge management platform adopted college-wide.  

Previously, as an Army Intelligence Officer, I learned to manage data integrity, coordinate with multi-agency teams, and handle confidential information with professionalism and precision—skills directly applicable to client tracking, billing, and HIPAA-compliant correspondence required for this role.

\lettersection{Alignment With This Role}
I bring a practical understanding of how medical, civic, and technological systems interface. Through working with underserved clinics such as Spanaway Community Healthcare and Tacoma Neighborhood Free Clinic, I helped patients navigate referrals, insurance applications, and transportation barriers—mirroring the task scope of this position.  

My certifications in HIPAA compliance, emergency medical services, and data management complement your program’s focus on accuracy and efficiency. I am also well-versed in leveraging secure software systems for case processing, reporting, and patient outreach.

\lettersection{Why Project Access Northwest}
Project Access Northwest’s mission to connect people with specialty and affordable care resonates deeply with my professional and personal values. Your emphasis on proactive plan monitoring, relationship-building, and compassionate communication reflects how I approach my work. I am eager to join an organization that shares my dedication to ensuring every patient receives the coordination, advocacy, and respect they deserve.

\lettersection{Closing}
Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to bring my background in healthcare systems, data operations, and patient advocacy to support the Premium Assistance and Specialty Medical Care Coordination programs at Project Access Northwest.
